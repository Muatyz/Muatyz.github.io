      <description>Abstract The pulse broadening and decay of coherent sound waves propagating in disordered granular media are investigated. We find that the pulse width of these compressional waves is broadened when the disorder is increased by mixing the beads made of different materials. To identify the responsible mechanism for the pulse broadening, we also perform the acoustic attenuation measurement by spectral analysis and the numerical simulation of pulsed sound wave propagation along 1D disordered elastic chains. The qualitative agreement between experiment and simulation reveals a dominant mechanism by scattering attenuation at the high-frequency range, which is consistent with theoretical models of sound wave scattering in strongly random media via a correlation length. 我们研究了相干声波在无序颗粒介质中传播时的脉冲展宽和衰减。</description>

      <description>X.jia Abstract Experimental observations of pulsed ultrasonic transmission through granular glass beads under oedometric loading are presented. We observe in the transmitted signals the coexistence of a coherent ballistic pulse traveling through an “effective contact medium” and a specklelike multiply scattered signal. The relative amplitudes of these signals strongly depend on the ratios of the bead size to the wavelength and to the detector size. Experimental data support recent descriptions of the inhomogeneous stress field within granular media. 本文介绍了在气压加载条件下脉冲超声波穿过颗粒状玻璃珠的实验观察结果。我们在传输信号中观察到，在</description>

      <description>Abstract Formulating a statistical mechanics for granular matter remains a significant challenge, in part due to the difficulty associated with a complete characterization of the systems under study. We present a fully characterized model of a granular material consisting of $N$ two-dimensional, frictionless hard disks, confined between hard walls, including a complete enumeration of all possible jammed structures. We show that the properties of the jammed packings are independent of the distribution of defects within the system and that all the packings are isostatic. This suggests that the assumption of equal probability for states of equal volume, which provides one possible way of constructing the equivalent of a microcanonical ensemble, is likely to be valid for our model. An application of the second law of thermodynamics involving two subsystems in contact shows that the expected spontaneous equilibration of defects between</description>

      <description>Abstract Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. 扭曲双层石墨烯(TBG)是最近发现的一种二维超晶格结构, 它表现出强相关量子多体物理学, 包括奇异的金属行为和非常规超导性. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05°$, which are nevertheless very fragile. TBG 的大部分奇异特性都与在所谓的魔</description>

      <description>Moiré bands in twisted double-layer graphene 双层石墨烯出现转角时, 在整体层面会出现摩尔纹. Abstract A moiré pattern is formed when two copies of a periodic pattern are overlaid with a relative twist. We address the electronic structure of a twisted two-layer graphene system, showing that in its continuum Dirac model the moiré pattern periodicity leads to moiré Bloch bands. The two layers become more strongly coupled and the Dirac velocity crosses zero several times as the twist angle is reduced. For a discrete set of magic angles the velocity vanishes, the lowest moiré band flattens, and the Dirac-point density-of states and the counterflow conductivity</description>
