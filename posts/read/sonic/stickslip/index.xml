      <description>Abstract Rate- and state-dependent friction (RSF) equations are commonly used to describe the time-dependent frictional response of fault gouge to perturbations in sliding velocity. Among the better-known versions are the Aging and Slip laws for the evolution of state. Although the Slip law is more successful, neither can predict all the robust features of lab data. RSF laws are also empirical, and their micromechanical origin is a matter of much debate. Here we use a granular physics-based model to explore the extent to which RSF behavior, as observed in rock and gouge friction experiments, can be explained by the response of a granular gouge layer with time-independent properties at the contact scale. 与速率和状态相关的摩擦（RSF）方程常用于描述断层破碎带</description>

      <description>Abstract We study the rheology of a dense granular suspension under shear strain with the simultaneous detection of multiply scattered ultrasound through the shear band. At a low shear rate, the dissipation is rate-independent and determined by the frictional contacts between grains. Under quasistatic shear, the stress–strain curve contains elastic loading parts interrupted by stress drops. Such an intermittency is concomitant with some large decorrelation events as measured by the ultrasound probe, sensitive to the position of the grains. Under cyclic shear, the correlations between the scattered ultrasonic waves show that at low shear strain, the grains exhibit reversible motion. Beyond this linear regime, some irreversible motion of the grains is detected. Moreover, the correlation between successive ultrasound signals suggests that some specific rearrangements, which add to the</description>

      <description>Abstract Strong earthquakes with larger magnitude and longer durations trigger many landslides, however, how magnitude and duration affect landslides is still unclear. Many factors could contribute to this, including additional shear stress provided by strong ground motion, or “seismogenic liquefaction”; herein, we hypothesize that the dynamic weakening of sliding zone gouge is important. We explored the influence of earthquake magnitude and duration on landslide triggering by simulating the seismic response of sliding zone gouge using a dynamic ring-shear device and glass spheres. 震级较大、持续时间较长的强震会引发许多滑坡，但震级和持续时间如何影响</description>

      <description>DOI:10.1029/2023JB026612 Abstract Stress accumulation and release reflected by acoustic emissions (AEs) during shearing of granular materials provide important information on failure mechanisms in seismic faults and landslides controlled by stick-slip. Among many characteristics (amplitude, energy, counts, and frequency) of AE signals generated by stick-slip, stress changes corresponding to various frequency AEs in different stages of the stickslip process are not clear, which limits our knowledge of the characteristics of precursory signals before stickslip failure. To better understand the physical mechanisms of granular stick-slip, we monitored the mechanical and AE signals using high-frequency ($2 \text{MHz}$) synchronous acquisition during constant-speed shear of packs of uniform glass beads with different sizes at different normal stresses. 颗粒材料剪切过程中的声发射（AEs）所反映的应力积累和释</description>
